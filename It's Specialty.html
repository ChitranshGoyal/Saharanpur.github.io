                <h1> <b> <i> Wood Art </i> </b> </h1>
                <h2>Saharanpur (India) is internationally famous for wood carving. Dating back to about 400 years in Mughal period, some craftsmen came from Kashmir and settled down in Saharanpur and took this work as to earn their bread and butter. Gradually this art got extended amongst common man in Saharanpur.</h2>
                <h2>Carving is done either completely by hand or in combination with an electric saw. The saw is usually employed to
                    make geometric patterns in wooden boxes. The whole operation is started by drawing the pattern intended to
                    be carved on a piece of paper and pasting it over the surface. Holes are drilled to precisely (and quickly) carve out
                    the negative spaces.</h2>
                    <h2>Carving completely by hand makes for a very fascinating sight. Though the instruments used are extremely
                        simple (saw, plane, fine-grained hard stone, chisels etc.), the carvers use them aptly to produce some astonishing
                        results with minute details, keeping the intricacies and subtle light and shade effects, every desired curve, expression and texture. Young kids help their fathers in carving, as this is the most time taking process out of them all.
                        Sometimes, this is also to bring in more money</h2>
