            <h1><i><b>How Is Saharnpur Named?</b></i></h1>
            <p>Saharanpur, city, northwestern Uttar Pradesh state, northern India. It is situated at the northern end of the Upper
            Ganges-Yamuna Doab, about 35 miles (56 km) west-northwest of Haridwar, Uttarakhand. Saharanpur was founded about 1340
            and is named for Shah Haran Chishti, a Muslim saint.</p>

            <h1><b><i>It's Mughal Period(1757–1803 AD)</i></b></h1>
            <p>In 1757, the Maratha Army invaded the Saharanpur region, which resulted in Najeeb-ud-Daula losing control of Saharanpur
            to the Maratha rulers Raghunath Rao and Malharao Holkar. The conflict between Rohillas and Marathas came to an end on 18
            December 1788 with the arrest of Ghulam Qadir, the grandson of Najeeb-ud-Daula, who was defeated by the Maratha general
            Mahadaji Scindia. The most significant contribution of Nawab Ghulam Qadir to Saharanpur city is the Nawab Ganj area and
            the Ahmedabadi fortress therein, which still stands. The death of Ghulam Qadir put an end to the Rohilla administration
            in Saharanpur and it became the northernmost district of the Maratha Empire. Ghani Bahadur Banda was appointed its first
            Maratha governor. The Maratha Regime saw the construction of the Bhuteshwar Temple and Bagheshwar Temple in Saharanpur
            city. In 1803, following the Second Anglo-Maratha War, when British East India Company defeated the Maratha Empire,
            Saharanpur came under British suzerainty.</p>

            <h1><b><i>It's British Time(1803–1947 AD)</i></b></h1>
            <p>When India rebelled in 1857 against the foreign Company's occupation, now referred to as the First War of Indian
            Independence, the Saharanpur and the present-day Muzaffarnagar Districts were part of that uprising. The centre of
            freedom fighters' operations was Shamli, a small town in the Muzaffarnagar region which was liberated for some time.
            After the uprising failed, British retribution was severe. Death and destruction were particularly directed against
            Muslims of the region, whom the British considered as the main instigators of the rebellion; Muslim society was
            devastated beyond recognition. When social reconstruction started, the cultural and political history of Muslims began
            to revolve around Deoband and Aligarh. Maulana Muhammad Qasim Nanotvi and Maulana Rashid Ahmad Gangohi, both proponents
            of the reformer Shah Waliullah's ideology for social and political rejuvenation, established a school in Deoband in
            1867. It found popularity and global recognition as the Darul Uloom. Its founders' mission was twofold: to raise and
            spread a team of scholars able to awaken the religious and social consciousness of Muslims through peaceful methods and
            to make efforts, through them, to educate Muslims in their faith and culture; and to bring about a feeling of
            nationalism and national unity by promoting the concept of Hindu-Muslim unity and a united India. Muslim scholars in the
            city of Saharanpur were active supporters of this ideology and went on to establish the Mazahirul Uloom Saharanpur
            theological seminary six months later.</p>
